                  <p class="lead">Larry J. Blake, Jr. is an experienced legal professional who has practiced in several areas of the law since his admission to the Oregon State Bar in 1987, including family (pre- and post-dissolution matters), probate, criminal defense, personal injury, and general civil law. Mr. Blake graduated from the University of Washington and Lewis and Clark Law School. He is a former Deputy District Attorney for the Clackamas County District Attorney’s Office, where he handled criminal matters. After his employment as a Deputy District Attorney, Mr. Blake prosecuted cases for the Oregon State Bar. Mr. Blake transitioned to private practice in 1993.
                  </br></br>
                    Mr. Blake works as a Municipal Court Judge for several cities throughout the state. These cities include Happy Valley, Newberg, Dayton, Amity, Carlton, Willamina, Lafayette, Manzanita, Estacada, Sweet Home, Harrisberg, Monroe, Corvallis, Philomath, and Detroit.
                  </br></br>
                    In his free time, Mr. Blake enjoys traveling, spending time with his family, and restoring his classic Camaros. Although he has had many professional successes on behalf of his clients, Mr. Blake’s proudest accomplishment remains his marriage of more than fourty years to his wife, and their three children.</p>

In some situations, usually with clients' prior knowledge, we may provide information to another individual or organization (such as client's accountants, stock brokers, money managers, realtors or insurance agents) to obtain information or assist in providing the legal services requested. In all such situations, we stress the confidential nature of information being shared.
